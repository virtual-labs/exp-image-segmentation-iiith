The experiment is designed to understand and learn two classes of Image Segmentation methods. This experiment consists of two different segmentation methods:

a. Histogram based Segmentation methods
b. Region growing based segmentation method

**Steps to run the experiments**

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option
   - Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel
2. Select one option from Histogram based Segmentation and Region growing
   - For Histogram based Segmentation
     1. Select one of the options: Manual Threshold or Automatic Threshold
     2. Manual Thresholding
        a. Select Single threshold or Double threshold and press Run
        b. Adjust the threshold on the image histogram space and press the Proceed
     3. Automatic threshold
        a. Press Run
   - For Region growing
        a. Select seed point on the image panel and choose one of the following option
        b. Mean-based
           1. Select range for different underlying parameters
        c. Variance-based , Select the range
           1. Select range for different underlying parameters Select run option to perform the operations3. Output result will be displayed in the output panel

**Interesting Observations**

1. Try using different seed point locations for region growing method
2. Compare results obtained from two different thresholding methods, particularly on tiger image.
