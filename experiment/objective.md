The broad objective of this experiment is to understand the challenges in extracting objects/regions of interest from a given images. Towards this, you will

1. Study the thresholding-based segmentation technique
   - Understand how the threshold can be selected from the image histogram and its effect on segmentation performance
   - Understand the difference between single and double thresholding
2. Study the region growing technique for segmentation
   - Understand how the seed selection affects segmentation performance
