The experiment is designed to understand and learn two classes of Image Segmentation methods. This experiment consists of two different segmentation methods:  

a. Histogram-based Segmentation methods  
b. Region-growing-based Segmentation method  

**Steps to run the experiments**  

1. Select an image from the mosaic using the 'select image' option.  
2. Select a region of the image to load it into the input image panel.  
3. Select one option from Histogram-based Segmentation or Region-growing.  
   - For Histogram-based Segmentation:  
      1. Select one of the options: Manual Threshold or Automatic Threshold.  
         - Manual Thresholding:  
           a. Select Single threshold or Double threshold and press Run.  
           b. Adjust the threshold on the image histogram space and press Proceed.  
         - Automatic Threshold:  
           a. Press Run.  
   - For Region-growing:  
      1. Select a seed point on the image panel and choose one of the following options:  
         - Mean-based:  
            a. Select the range for different underlying parameters.  
         -  Variance-based:  
            a. Select the range for different underlying parameters.  
      2. Press the Run option to perform the operations.  
4. The output result will be displayed in the output panel.  

**Interesting Observations**  

1. Try using different seed point locations for the region-growing method.  
2. Compare results obtained from two different thresholding methods, particularly on the tiger image.
